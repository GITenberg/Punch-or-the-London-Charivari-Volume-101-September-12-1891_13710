    <h2>SOME CIRCULAR NOTES.</h2>

    <h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>

    <h4><i>Reims&mdash;Solemnity&mdash;Relief&mdash;En
    voiture&mdash;Politeness&mdash;Calling&mdash;Calves&mdash;Caves&mdash;Starting&mdash;Cocher&mdash;Duet.</i></h4>

    <p>Seen the Cathedral. Grand. As I am not making notes for a
    Guide-book, shall say nothing about it. "Don't mention it." I
    shan't. Much struck by the calm air of repose about Reims. So
    silent is it, that DAUBINET's irrepressible singing in the
    solemn court-yard of the Hotel comes quite as a relief. It is
    an evidence of life. This Hotel's exceptional quietude suggests
    the idea of its being conducted like a prison on the silent
    system, with, of course, dumbwaiters to assist in the
    peculiarly clean and tidy <i>salle à manger</i>.</p>

    <p>"Petzikoff! Blass the Prince of WAILES!" sings out DAUBINET,
    whose <i>Mark-Tapley</i>-like spirits would probably be only
    exhilarated by a lonely night in the Catacombs. Then he shakes
    hands with me violently. In France he insists upon shaking
    hands on every possible occasion with anybody, in order to
    convey to his own countrymen the idea of what a thorough Briton
    he is.</p>

    <p>"<i>Vous avez eu votre café? Eh bien alors&mdash;allons!
    pour passer chez mon ami</i> VESQUIER," says DAUBINET, at the
    same time signalling a meandering fly-driver who, having pulled
    up near the Cathedral, is sitting lazily on his box perusing a
    newspaper. He looks up, catches sight of DAUBINET, nods, folds
    up the paper, sits on it, gives the reins one shake to wake up
    the horse, and another, with a crack of his whip, to set the
    sleepy animal in motion, and, the animal being partially
    roused, he drives across the street to us. DAUBINET directs
    him, and on we go, lumbering and rattling through the town,
    meeting only one other <i>voiture</i>, whose driver appears
    infinitely amused at his friend having obtained a fare. Some
    chaff passes between them, which to me is unintelligible, and
    which DAUBINET professes not to catch, but I fancy, whatever it
    is, it is not highly complimentary to our <i>cocher's</i>
    fares. In one quarter through which we drive, they are setting
    up the booths and roundabouts for a Fair.</p>

    <p>"They can't do much business here," I observe to my
    companion.</p>

    <p>"Immense!" he replies.&mdash;"But there's no one about."</p>

             alt="When abroad, an Englishman should never omit the smallest chance of taking off his hat and bowing profoundly." />
        </a>
    </div>

    <p>"There will be," he returns. "Manufacturing
    town&mdash;everybody engaged in business. Bell
    rings&mdash;<i>Caramba!</i>&mdash;out they come, like the
    cigarette-makers in <i>Carmen</i>." Here he hums a short
    musical extract from BIZET's Opera, then resumes&mdash;"Town's
    all alive&mdash;then, after dinner, back to
    business&mdash;evening time out to play, to <i>cafés</i>, to
    the Fair! God save the QUEEN!"</p>

    <p>"But there's nothing doing at night, as we saw when we
    arrived yesterday," I observe.</p>

    <p>"No," says DAUBINET; "it is an early place." Then he sings,
    "If you're waking"&mdash;he pronounces it
    "whacking"&mdash;"call me early, mothair dear!" finishing up
    with a gay laugh, and a guttural ejaculation in Russian; at
    least, I fancy it is Russian. "Ah! <i>voilà!</i>" We have
    pulled up before a very clean-looking and handsome
    <i>façade</i>. The carriage-gates are closed, but a side-door
    is immediately opened, and a neat elderly woman answers
    DAUBINET's inquiries to his perfect satisfaction. "VESQUIER
    <i>est chez lui. Entrez donc!</i>" We enter, profoundly
    saluting the porteress. When abroad, an Englishman should never
    omit the smallest chance of taking off his hat and bowing
    profoundly, no matter to whom it may be. Every Englishman
    abroad represents "All England"&mdash;not the eleven, but the
    English character generally, and therefore, when among people
    noted for their politeness, he should be absolutely remarkable
    for his courteous manners. As a rule, to which there can be no
    exception taken, never lose any opportunity of lifting your
    hat, and making your most polished bow. This, in default of
    linguistic facility, is universally understood and appreciated
    in all civilised countries. In uncivilised countries, to remove
    your hat, or to bow, may be taken as a gross outrage on good
    manners, or as signifying some horrible immorality, in which
    case the offender would not have the chance of repeating his
    well-intentioned mistake. But within the limits of Western
    enlightenment to bow is mere civility, and may be taken as a
    preface to conversation; to omit it is to show lack of breeding
    and to court hostility. Therefore, N.B. <i>Rule in
    travelling</i>&mdash;Bow to everybody. And this, by the way,
    is, after all, only <i>Sir Pertinax Macsycophant's</i> receipt
    for getting on in the world by "boo'ing and boo'ing."</p>

    <p>We pass through a courtyard, reminding me of the kind of
    courtyard still to be seen in some of our old London City
    houses-of-business. This, however, is modernised with
    whitewash. Here also, it being a Continental court-yard, are
    the inevitable orange-trees in huge green tubs placed at the
    four corners. A few pigeons feeding, a blinking cat curled up
    on a mat, pretending to take no sort of interest in the birds,
    and a little child playing with a cart. Such is this picture.
    Externally, not much like a house of business; but it is, and
    of big business too. We enter a cool and tastefully furnished
    apartment. Here M. VESQUIER receives us cordially. He has a
    military bearing, suggesting the idea of a Colonel <i>en
    retraite</i>. I am preparing compliments and interrogatories in
    French, when he says, in good plain English, with scarcely an
    accent&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Now DAUBINET has brought you here, we must show you the
    calves, and then back to breakfast. Will that suit you?"</p>

    <p>"Perfectly." I think to myself&mdash;why "calves"? It
    sounded like "calves," only without the "S." Must ask
    presently.</p>

    <p>M. VESQUIER begs to be excused for a minute; he will return
    directly. I look to DAUBINET for an explanation. "We are, then,
    going to see a farm, I presume?" I say to him. "Farm!" exclaims
    DAUBINET, surprised. "<i>Que voulez-vous dire, mon
    cher?</i>"&mdash;"Well, didn't Mister&mdash;Mister&mdash;"
    "VESQUIER," suggests DAUBINET.</p>

    <p>"Yes, Mister VESQUIER&mdash;didn't he say we were to go and
    'see the calves'?&mdash;<i>C'est à dire</i>," I translate, in
    despair at DAUBINET's utterly puzzled look, "<i>que nous irons
    avec lui à la ferme pour voir les veaux</i>&mdash;the
    calves."&mdash;"Ha! ha! ha!" Off goes DAUBINET into a roar.
    Evidently I've made some extraordinary mistake. It flashes
    across me suddenly. Owing to M. VESQUIER's speaking such
    excellent English, it never occurred to me that he had suddenly
    interpolated the French word "<i>caves</i>" as an anglicised
    French word into his speech to me. This accounts for his
    suppression of the final consonant.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/121-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/121-2.png"
             alt="DAUBINET amuses himself by sitting on the box and talking to the coachman." />
        </a>
    </div>

    <p>"Ah!" I exclaim, suddenly enlightened; "I see&mdash;the
    cellars."</p>

    <p>"<i>Pou ni my?</i>" cries DAUBINET, still in ecstasies, and
    speaking Russian or modern Greek. "<i>Da!</i>&mdash;of
    course&mdash;<i>c'est ça&mdash;nous allons voir les
    caves</i>&mdash;the cellars&mdash;where all the champagne is.
    <i>Karrascho!</i>"</p>

    <p>At this moment M. VESQUIER returns. He will just take us
    through the offices to his private rooms. Clerks at work
    everywhere. Uncommonly like an English place of business: not
    much outward difference between French clerks in a large house
    like this and English ones in one of our great City houses;
    only this isn't the City, but is, so to speak, more
    Manchesterian or Liverpoolian, with the immense advantage of
    being remarkably clean, curiously quiet, and in a pure and
    fresh atmosphere. I don't clearly understand what M. VESQUIER's
    business is, but as he seems to take for granted that I know
    all about it, I trust to getting DAUBINET alone and obtaining
    definite information from him. Are they VESQUIER's caves we are
    going to see? "No," DAUBINET tells me presently, quite
    surprised, at my ignorance; "we are going to see <i>les caves
    de Popperie</i>&mdash;Popp &amp; Co., only Co.'s out of it, and
    it's all POPP now."</p>

    <p>"Now then, Gentlemen," says the <i>gérant</i> of POPP &amp;
    Co, "here's a <i>voiture</i>. We have twenty minutes' drive."
    The Popp-Manager points out to me all the interesting features
    of the country. DAUBINET amuses himself by sitting on the box
    and talking to the coachman.</p>

    <p>"It excites me," he explains, when requested to take a back
    seat inside&mdash;though, by the way, it is in no sense
    DAUBINET's <i>métier</i> to "take a back seat,"&mdash;"it
    excites me&mdash;it amuses me to talk to a <i>cocher. On ne
    peut pas causer avec un vrai cocher tous les jours.</i>" And
    presently we see them gesticulating to each other and talking
    both at once, DAUBINET, of course, is speaking English and
    various other languages, but as little French as possible, to
    the evident bewilderment of the driver. DAUBINET is perfectly
    happy. "Petzikoff! Blass the Prince of WAILES!" I hear him
    bursting out occasionally. Whereat the coachman smiles
    knowingly, and flicks the horses.</p>

    <h2>THE TWO WINDS.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Fairy Story for the Season of 1891. Imitated&mdash;at
    a distance&mdash;from Hans Andersen's celebrated Tale of "The
    Four Winds."</i>)</h4>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/122.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/122.png"
             alt="The Two Winds." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The Mother of the Winds (acting as <i>locum tenens</i> for
    her Clerk of the Weather, who, sick of his own unseasonable
    work, was off to spend his annual holiday with Mr. ROBERT LOUIS
    STEVENSON in the Pacific Isles), received the desperately damp,
    dishevelled, blown-about, and almost heart-broken Princess
    AGRICULTURA at the door of the Cave.</p>

    <p>"Oh, here you are again!" she cried, "once more in the
    Cavern of the Winds! And this time you have brought two of my
    sons with you, I see," she added, pointing to the South Wind
    and the West Wind, who were blowing away at the Princess like
    bellowsy blends of Blizzards, Cloud-bursts, Tornadoes and
    Tritons.</p>

    <p>"Oh, do for pity's sake, stop them!" cried AGRICULTURA,
    struggling hard to keep herself and her garments together. "It
    seems as though the heavens have become one vast sluice, that
    keeps pouring down water, as my predecessor, the Prince, put
    it. I have not a dry thread about me. <i>Please</i> put them in
    their Bags&mdash;<i>do</i>&mdash;whilst I have a little talk
    with you about them, and the mischief they have been
    doing."</p>

    <p>Two prolonged chuckles, a deep stentorian one and a sharp
    staccato one, came from the two Bags already hanging to the
    wall of the Cavern, from whence subsequently protruded the
    round ruddy form of the North and the pinched figure of the
    East Wind. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"
       id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span> "Ho! ho! ho!" chortled the
       North Wind, chokingly. "Who says <i>I</i> do all the
       damage?"</p>

    <p>"He! he! he!" sniggered the East Wind, raspingly. "Who is
    the pickle and spoil-sport <i>now</i>, I should like to
    know?"</p>

    <p>"Shut up!" said the Mother of the Winds, sharply. "And as to
    you two," she added, turning to the South and West Winds, "if
    you don't stand still and give an account of yourselves, I'll
    pop you into your respective Bags in the twinkling of a
    hundred-ton gun!"</p>

    <p>"Why, who is <i>she</i>, that she should call us over the
    clouds?" cried the two Winds, stopping their blowing a bit, and
    pointing to the Princess.</p>

    <p>"She is my guest," said the old woman; "and if that does not
    satisfy you, you need only get into the Bags. Do you understand
    me now?"</p>

    <p>Well, this did the business at once; and the two Winds, in a
    breath, began to relate whence they came, and what they had
    been doing for nearly three months past.</p>

    <p>"We have been spoiling the English Summer," they said.</p>

    <p>"<i>That's</i> nothing new," muttered the Mother of the
    Winds.</p>

    <p>"<i>Isn't</i> it, though&mdash;in the way <i>we've</i> done
    it?" cried the two, triumphantly. "Why, those two Boys over
    yonder, uniting their flatulent forces, could not have done
    better&mdash;or worse. Ho! ho! ho! <i>They</i> made last winter
    a frozen Sahara. <i>We've</i> made the present summer a squashy
    Swamp! The winter was as dry as the dust of RAMESES. The summer
    has been as wet as old St. Swithin's gingham. We soaked June,
    we drenched July, and we drowned August. We squelched the
    strawberry season, reducing tons of promising fruit to
    flavourless pulp, and the growers to damp despair. Whooosh!!
    What a wetting we gave 'em!!! As soon as the Cricket Season
    started, so did <i>we</i>! Didn't we just? We simply sopped all
    the wickets, and spoilt all the matches, either keeping the
    cricketers waiting in the pavilion or slipping about on sloppy
    slithery turf. Consequently, the Cricketing Season has been a
    sickening sell. We 'watered down' the 'averages' of all the
    'cracks.' S.W. was too many for W.G. (GRACE, of Gloucester),
    and W.W. gave the <i>other</i> W.W. (READ, of Surrey) a fair
    doing! We followed 'The Leviathan' in particular about
    persistently, till he must be real glad to 'take his hook' to
    Australia. Wherever <i>he</i> was playing, from Kennington to
    Clifton, we combined our forces, swooped down on him, and
    simply washed him out!"</p>

    <p>"Wanton wags!" said the Mother of the Winds,
    reproachfully.</p>

    <p>"Ra-<i>ther</i>," yelled her promising offspring in chorus.
    "But that's not all, <i>is</i> it, S.W.?&mdash;<i>is</i> it
    W.W.? We mucked up Lawn Tennis, soaked Henley Regatta, nearly
    spoilt the German EMPEROR's visit, ruined all the <i>al
    fresco</i> functions of the Season&mdash;slap!&mdash;flooded
    Society out of London, only to deluge them in their flitting
    till they wished they were back again, intensified the
    Influenza Epidemic, and&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh! stop, stop!" moaned the Old Woman. "Those Boys yonder
    will burst&mdash;with jealousy. But what have you been doing to
    the Princess AGRICULTURA here?"</p>

    <p>The two broke into a spasmodic duo of delight and disdain.
    "Why <i>look</i> at her?" they cried. "Doesn't she speak for
    herself?"</p>

    <p>"I <i>do</i>," replied AGRICULTURA. "And I charge this pair
    of Pernicious Pickles with planning&mdash;and to a large extent
    effecting&mdash;my Destruction! Hay, Hops, Cereals, Root-Crops,
    Fruits and Flowers&mdash;all ruined by these roystering
    rascals. They've done more incurable mischief in three
    supposed-to-be Summer Months than those much-maligned Boys over
    yonder did all the Winter. They've had it all their own way the
    Season through, ay, as much as though they'd nailed the
    weathercock to S.W., and knocked out the bottom of Aquarius's
    water-pot. And I call upon you, O Mother of the Winds, to pop
    them at once into their respective Bags, sit upon them till
    they are choked silent and still, and then hang them up to
    dry&mdash;if dry such watery imps <i>can</i>&mdash;for at least
    six months to come!"</p>

    <p>Now whether the Mother of the Winds gave ear to the prayer
    of the poor Princess AGRICULTURA, and imposed upon the Two
    Winds the punishment they richly deserved, the sequel must
    show.</p>

    are POONSH. You are a Thrupni but you are not a Mahatma. Be a
    Mahatma, and save your postage expenses. But you must be

    if he is not vague. You must also be elusive. Can you elude? It
    is no light matter to prove one's spiritual capacity by
    materialising a cigarette inside a grand piano.</p>

    <p>2. Your reply to my letter is soulless and sceptical. How
    <i>can</i> you ask me, O POONSH, what I am trying to get at? I
    ask nothing from you. It would be to your advantage rather than
    mine if you printed my poem on the Re-incarnation of Ginan
    Bittas, entitled <i>The Soul's Gooseberry Bush</i>. And if you
    will only be a Mahatma, or a disciple, I will gladly let you
    have the serial rights in that great work. What do you mean by
    saying you do not want to find cigarettes in your neighbour's
    piano? Think it over again, and you will see the beauty of it.
    You are a Thrupni, but surely you have <i>some</i> spiritual
    needs.</p>

    <p>3. You say that you do not want my poem, and you ask me if I
    have no further attractions to offer. I am KOOT HOOMIBOOG, and
    I have kept the greatest attraction for the last. If you will
    only join us, you <i>may</i> find a few newspapers who will
    discuss you. You may see the question whether you are a fool or
    a knave debated in the correspondence columns. Think of the
    glory of it!</p>

    <p>4. What? you won't? Well; I <i>am</i> surprised!</p>

    <h2>THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. VI.</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>Garden of the Hotel Victoria at Bingen,
        commanding a view of the Rhine and the vine-terraced hills,
        which are bathed in warm afternoon sunlight. Under the
        mopheaded acacias</i>, CULCHARD <i>and</i> PODBURY <i>are
        sitting smoking. At a little distance from them, are a
        Young Married Couple, whose honeymoon is apparently in its
        last quarter.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>The Bridegroom</i> (<i>lazily, to Bride, as she draws
    another chair towards her for a foot-rest</i>). How many
    <i>more</i> chairs do you want?</p>

    <p><i>Bride</i> (<i>without looking at him</i>). I should think
    you could spare me one&mdash;you can hardly sit on three at
    once!</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>After this interchange of amenities, they consider
        themselves absolved from any further conversational
        efforts.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>to</i> CULCH., <i>resuming a
    discussion</i>). I know as well as you do that we are booked
    for Nuremberg; but what <i>I</i> say is&mdash;that's no earthly
    reason why we should <i>go</i> there!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> No reason why <i>you</i> should go, unless you
    wish it, certainly. <i>I</i> intend to go.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Well, it's beastly selfish, that's all! I know
    <i>why</i> you're so keen about it, too. Because the TROTTERS
    are going.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>colouring</i>). That's an entire mistake
    on your part. Miss TROTTER has nothing to do with it. I don't
    even know whether she's going or not&mdash;for certain.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> No, but you've a pretty good idea that she
    <i>is</i>, though. And I <i>know</i> how it will be. You'll be
    going about with her all the time, and I shall be shunted on to
    the old man! I don't <i>see</i> it, you know! (CULCH.
    <i>remains silent. A pause.</i> PODBURY <i>suddenly begins to
    search his pockets</i>.) I say&mdash;here's a pretty fix! Look
    here, old fellow, doosid annoying thing, but I can't find my
    purse&mdash;must have lost it somewhere!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>stoically</i>). I can't say I'm surprised
    to hear it. It's awkward, certainly. I suppose I shall have to
    lend you enough to go home with&mdash;it's all I can do; but
    I'll do that with&mdash;er&mdash;pleasure.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>staring</i>). Go home? Why, I can wire to
    the governor for more, easily enough. We shall have to stay
    here till it comes, that's all.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> And give up Nuremberg? Thank you!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> I rather like this place, you know&mdash;sort
    of rest. And we could always nip over to Ems, or Homburg, if it
    got too slow, eh?</p>

    </div>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> If I nip over anywhere, I shall nip to
    Nuremberg. We may just as well understand one another, PODBURY.
    If I'm to provide money for both of us, it's only reasonable
    that you should be content to go where <i>I</i> choose. I
    cannot, and will not, stand these perpetual interferences with
    our original plan; it's sheer restlessness. Come with me to
    Nuremberg, and I shall be very happy to be your banker.
    Otherwise, you must stay here alone.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He compresses his lips and crosses his legs.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, <i>that</i>'s it, is it? But look here, why
    not tit up whether we go on or stay?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Why should I "tit up," as you call it, when
    I've already made up my mind to go. When I once decide on
    anything, it's final.</p>

    <p><i>The Bride</i> (<i>to Bridegroom, without enthusiasm</i>).
    Would you like me to roll you a cigarette?</p>

    <p><i>Bridegroom</i> (<i>with the frankness of an open
    nature</i>). Not if I know it. I can do it better myself.</p>

    <p><i>Bride</i> (<i>coldly</i>). I see.</p>

    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podbury</i> (<i>to Culch., in an undertone</i>). I say,
    those two don't seem to hit it off exactly, eh? Seem sorry they
    came! You'll be glad to hear, old fellow, that we needn't
    separate after all. Just found my purse in my
    trouser-pocket!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Better luck than you deserve. Didn't I tell
    you you should have a special pocket for your money and
    coupons? Like this&mdash;see. (<i>He opens, his coat.</i>) With
    a buttoned flap, it stands to reason they <i>must</i> be
    safe!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> So long as you keep it buttoned, old
    chap,&mdash;which you don't seem to do!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Pshaw! The button is a
    trifle too&mdash;(<i>feels pocket, and turns pale</i>). Good
    Heavens, it&mdash;it's <i>gone</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> The button?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>patting himself all over with shaking
    hands</i>). Everything!&mdash;money, coupons, circular notes!
    They&mdash;they must have fallen out going up that infernal
    Niederwald. (<i>Angrily.</i>) You <i>would</i> insist on
    going!</p>

    <p><i>Podb</i>. Phew! The whole bag of tricks gone! You're
    lucky if you get them again. Any number of tramps and beggars
    all the way up. Shouldn't have taken off your coat&mdash;very
    careless of you! (<i>He grins.</i>)</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> It was so hot. I must go and inform the Police
    here&mdash;I may recover it yet. Anyway, we&mdash;we must push
    on to Nuremberg, and I'll telegraph home for money to be sent
    there. You can let me have enough to get on with?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> With all the pleasure in life, dear
    boy&mdash;on your own conditions, you know. I mean, if I pay
    the piper, I call the tune. Now, I don't cotton to Nuremberg
    somehow; I'd rather go straight on to Constance; we could get
    some rowing there.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>pettishly</i>). Rowing be &mdash;&mdash;
    (<i>recollecting his helplessness</i>). No; but just consider,
    my dear PODBURY. I assure you you'll find Nuremberg a most
    delightful old place. You must see how bent I am on going
    there!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, yes, I see <i>that</i>. But then I'm
    <i>not</i>, don't you know&mdash;so there we are!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>desperately</i>). Well, I'll&mdash;I'll
    meet you half-way. I've no objection to&mdash;er&mdash;titting
    up with you&mdash;Nuremberg or Constance. Come?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> You weren't so anxious to tit up just
    now&mdash;but never mind. (<i>Producing a mark</i>.) Now then,
    Emperor&mdash;Constance. Eagle&mdash;Nuremberg. Is it sudden
    death, or best out of three? [<i>He tosses.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Sud&mdash;(<i>The coin falls with the Emperor
    uppermost.</i>) Best out of three.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[<i>He takes coin from</i> PODBURY <i>and
        tosses.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Eagle! we're even so far. (<i>He receives
    coin.</i>) This settles it. [<i>He tosses.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Eagle again! Now mind, PODBURY, no going back
    after <i>this.</i> It must <i>be</i> Nuremberg now.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> All right! And now allow me to have the
    pleasure of restoring your pocket-book and note-case. They did
    fall out on the Niederwald, and it was a good job for you I was
    behind and saw them drop. You must really be more careful, dear
    boy. Ain't you going to say "ta" for them?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>relieved</i>).
    I'm&mdash;er&mdash;tremendously obliged. I really can't say
    how.&mdash;(<i>Recollecting himself</i>.) But you need not have
    taken advantage of it to try to do me out of going to
    Nuremberg&mdash;it was a shabby trick!</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Oh, it was only to get a rise out of you. I
    never meant to keep you to it, of course. And I say, weren't
    you sold, though? Didn't I lead up to it beautifully? (<i>He
    chuckles.</i>) Score to me, eh!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with amiable sententiousness</i>). Ah,
    well, I don't grudge you your little joke if it amuses you.
    Those laugh best who laugh last. And it's settled now that
    we're going to Nuremberg.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Only in his own estimation, Mr. TROTTER. I
    have nailed him down to going to Nuremberg, which, for many
    reasons, I was extremely anxious to visit. (<i>Carelessly.</i>)
    Are we likely to be there when you are?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess not. We've just got our mail, and my
    cousin, CHARLEY VAN BOODELER, writes he's having a real lovely
    time in the Engadine&mdash;says it's the most elegant locality
    he's struck yet, and just as full of Amurrcans as it can hold;
    so we're going to start out there right away. I don't believe
    we shall have time for Nuremberg

    about Nuremberg. They&mdash;they say it's a good deal changed
    from what it was.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> So are <i>you</i>, old chap, if it comes to
    that. Tiddledy-iddlety-ido-lumpty-doodle-oo! Is it to be
    Constance after all, then?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> You artful old whistling oyster, <i>I</i> see
    what you're up to! But it's no go; she don't want either of us
    Engadining about after her. It's CHARLEY VAN STICKINTHEMUD's
    turn now! We've got to go to Nuremberg. You can't get out of
    it, after gassing so much about the place. When you've once
    decided, you know, it's <i>final</i>!</p>

             </a>Losing their heads on board the <i>Dauntless</i>.
    </div>

    <p>What, not remember it! Not the scene on Wapping Old Stairs
    and Mr. CHARLES GLENNEY in the Merchant Service, and Miss
    MILLWARD the Ward of Count GURNEY DELAUNAY! Not remember all
    that! Not recollect the pretty set with the River, the
    boat-house, and the figure-heads! Ah, tell it to the Marines!
    Not that they would believe you! I remember it, and a good deal
    more. Now it came about in this way. You see Miss MILLWARD
    thought that Lieutenant CHARLES WARNER, R.N.&mdash;"her
    sweetheart as a boy"&mdash;was dead, and, like a sensible young
    lady, made arrangements to marry his foster-brother, meaning
    GLENNEY. This she would have done most comfortably, had not the
    Count and a Boat-builder, one JULIAN CROSS PENNYCAD, objected.
    But after all, their opposition wouldn't have come to much
    hadn't Lieutenant CHARLES WARNER, R.N., taken it into his head
    to turn up from the Centre of Africa, or the Cannibal Islands,
    or somewhere. On second thoughts I don't think it could have
    been the Cannibal Islands, because <i>there</i> they would have
    certainly eaten him&mdash;he looked so plump, and in such
    excellent condition. Well, Lieutenant WARNER, R.N., finding
    that Miss MILLWARD was on the eve of marrying Mr. GLENNEY, most
    nobly made room for his foster-brother, and hurried back to
    sea. But as luck (and Mr. HENRY PETTIT) would have it, just as
    the lady and gentleman were on their way to Stepney Old Church
    to be spliced, who should turn up in a uniform that showed him
    to be a fine figure of a man but Lieutenant WARNER, R.N.,
    himself&mdash;with the Press Gang. It turned out that
    Lieutenant WARNER's ship was very under-manned, and that he had
    been ordered by his Captain to get all the sailors he could on
    board H.M.S. <i>Dauntless</i>&mdash;a vessel, by the way, that
    afterwards proved to be the very image of the <i>Victory</i>.
    And here came a complication. Through the treachery of JULIAN
    CROSS PENNYCAD, Lieutenant WARNER seized Mr. GLENNEY just as he
    and Miss MILLWARD were entering Stepney Old Church. Says Mr.
    GLENNEY to Lieutenant WARNER, "What, taking me, because you are
    jealous of me, on my wedding-day! You ought to be ashamed of
    yourself!" or words to that effect. Says Lieutenant WARNER,
    R.N., to Mr. GLENNEY, "Nothing of the sort. For the man who
    would betray another, save in the way of kindness, on his
    bridal morn, is unworthy of the name of a British sailor," or
    words to <i>that</i> effect. Then Miss MILLWARD chimed in, and
    thus touched the heart of Lieutenant WARNER, R.N., so deeply
    that he ordered Mr. GLENNEY's immediate release. "I forget my
    duty," explained the generous WARNER. "But I don't," put in his
    superior officer, Captain WILLIAM LUGG VERNON, "and I order
    that man to be carried on board!" and there was not a dry eye
    amongst those present, except, perhaps, amongst the heartless
    "Press Gang," who, having to write notices for the daily and
    weekly papers, were naturally eager to see what "In the
    Fo'castle" and "The Deck of the <i>Dauntless</i>" were like.
    And these they did see in the next Act of this really capital
    Drama. And here came in a scene that will long be remembered to
    the honour of the British Navy and the National and Royal
    Theatre, Drury Lane. There came a mutiny, with the misguided
    GLENNEY at the head of it. Said Captain WILLIAM LUGG VERNON,
    after it was quelled, "We can't spare a man, and so I shall
    have Mr. GLENNEY flogged." "Don't do that," cried Lieutenant
    WARNER; "he is my brother and my friend, although he has given
    me a oner, owing to a misunderstanding. Captain, may I appeal
    to these men, and ask them in stirring language, to fight the
    foe." "You shall," replied his superior officer; "and, by
    arrangement with Mr. HENRY PETTITT, I will see that '<i>Rule
    Britannia</i>' is played softly by an efficient orchestra while
    you are speaking to them." "A thousand thanks!" cried the
    eloquent WARNER; and then he let them have it. He told them
    that the enemy were waiting for them&mdash;that they had left
    Brest for the purpose of engaging in a first-class naval
    engagement. He pointed out that the other ships of the Fleet
    were on their way to the scrimmage. "Would the gallant
    <i>Dauntless</i> be the only laggard?" "No!" shouted the
    now-amenable-to-naval-discipline GLENNEY, and with the rest of
    the malcontents, he asked to be led to glory. It was indeed
    stirring to see the red-coats waving their hats on the tops of
    their bayonets, and the Blue Jackets brandishing their swords.
    In the enthusiasm of the moment, the entire ship's company
    seemed to have lost their heads, and cheers came from the deck,
    and the auditorium equally. It was a moment of triumph for
    everyone concerned! Everyone! And need I say anything more?
    Need I tell you how it came right in the end? How Miss MILLWARD
    (who was always on the eve of being married to someone) did
    actually go through a civil ceremony (the French were polite
    even in the days before Waterloo) with the Count, which,
    however, failed to count (as an old wag, with a taste for
    ancient jests, observed to a brother droll), because the Gallic
    nobleman got killed immediately after the ceremony? Need I hint
    that Mr. GLENNEY was falsely accused of murder, to be rescued
    at the right moment by the ever-useful and forgiving WARNER?
    Need I say that Mr. HENRY PETTITT was cheered to the echo for
    his piece, and Sir AUGUSTUS DRURIOLANUS for his stage
    management? No, for other chronicles have given the news
    already; and it is also superfluous to describe the fun of
    those excellent comedians, Mr. HARRY NICHOLLS and Miss FANNY
    BROUGH. All I can say is, if you want to see a good piece, well
    mounted, and capitally acted all round, why go to Old Drury,
    and you will agree with me (and the old wag with a taste for
    ancient jests) that Sir AUGUST-US might add September, October,
    November, and December to his signature, as <i>A Sailor's
    Knot</i> seems likely to remain tied to the Knightly Boards
    until it is time to produce the Christmas Pantomime. So heave
    away, my hearties, and good luck to you!</p>

    <h3>THE MYSTERY OF MAY FARE.</h3>

    <h4>(BY ONE BEHIND THE SEENS.)</h4>

    <h4>CHAPTER I.&mdash;<i>Despare!</i></h4>

    <p>It was Midnite! The bewtifool Countess of BELGRAVIER sat at
    the hopen winder of her Boodwar gazing on the full moon witch
    was jest a rising up above the hopposite chimbleys. Why was
    that evenly face, that princes had loved and Poets sillybrated,
    bathed in tears? How offen had she, wile setting at that hopen
    winder, washed it with Oder Colone, to remove the stanes of
    them tell tail tears? But all in wane, they wood keep running
    down that bewtifool face as if enamelled with its buty; and
    quite heedless of how they was a spiling of her new ivory
    cullered sattin dress that Maddam ELISE's yung ladies had been
    a workin on up to five a clock that werry arternoon.</p>

    <p>She had bin to the great ball of the Season, to be washupped
    as usual by the world of Fashun, but wot had driven her home at
    the hunerthly hour of harf-parst Eleven? Ah, that cruel blo,
    that deadly pang, that despairin shok, must be kep for the nex
    chapter.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.&mdash;<i>The Helopemeant!</i></h4>

    <p>Seated in the House-keeper's own Room at the Dook of
    SURREY's lovely Manshun, playfoolly patting his fatted calves,
    and surrounded by his admiring cirkle, sat CHARLES, the ero of
    my Tale. CHARLES was the idle of that large establishment. They
    simply adored him. It was not only his manly bewty, tho that
    mite have made many an Apoller envy him. It was not only his
    nolledge of the world, tho in that he was sooperior to menny a
    Mimber of Parlyment from the Sister Oil, but it was his stile,
    his grace, his orty demeaner. The House-keeper paid him marked
    attenshuns. The Ladies Maid supplyed him with Sent for his
    ankerchers. The other Footmen looked up to him as their moddel,
    and ewen the sollem Butler treated him with respec, and
    sumtimes with sumthink else as he liked even better. The
    leading Gentlemen from other Doocal establishments charfed him
    upon his success with the Fare, ewen among the werry hiest of
    the Nobillerty, and CHARLES bore it all with a good-natured
    larf that showed off his ivory teeth to perfecshun. Of course
    it was all in fun, as they said, and probberly thort, till on
    this fatal ewening, the noose spread like thunder, through the
    estonished world of Fashun, that CHARLES had heloped with the
    welthy, the middle-aged, but still bewtifool, Marchioness of
    ST. BENDIGO.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.&mdash;<i>The Dewell</i>.</h4>

    <p>The pursoot was rapid and sucksessful, and the MARKISS's
    challenge reyther disterbed the gilty pair at their ellegant
    breakfast. But CHARLES was as brave as he was fare, and, having
    hired his fust Second for twenty-five francs, and made a few
    other erangements, he met his hantigginest on the dedly field
    on the follering day at the hunerthly hour of six hay hem.
    CHARLES, with dedly haim, fired in the hair! but the MARKISS
    being bald, he missed him. The MARKISS's haim was even more
    dedly, for he, aperiently, shot his rival in his hart, for he
    fell down quite flat on the new-mown hay, and dishcullered it
    with his blud!</p>

    <p>The MARKISS rushed up, and gave him one look of orror, and,
    throwing down a £1000 pound note, sed, "that for any one who
    brings him two," and, hurrying away to his Carridge, took the
    next train for Lundon. CHARLES recovered hisself emediately,
    and, pocketing the note, winked his eye at the second second,
    and, giving him a hundred-franc note for hisself, wiped away
    the stains of the rouge and water, and returned to breakfast
    with his gilty parrer-mour.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.&mdash;<i>The End</i>.</h4>

    <p>The poor MARKISS was so horryfied at his brillyant sucksess,
    that CHARLES's sanguinery corpse aunted his bed-side, and he
    died within a munth, a leetle munth, as <i>Amlet</i> says, of
    the dredful ewent, and CHARLES married his Widder. But, orful
    to relate, within a werry short time CHARLES was a sorrowin
    Widderer, with a nincum of sum £10,000 a year; and having
    purchased a Itallien titel for a hundred and fifty pound, it is
    said as he intends shortly to return to hold Hingland; and as
    the lovely Countess of BELGRAVIER is fortnetly becum a Widder,
    and a yung one, it is thought quite posserbel, by them as is
    behind the seens, like myself, for instance, that before many
    more munce is past and gone, there will be one lovely Widder
    and one andsum Widderer less than there is now; and we is all
    on us ankshushly looking forred to the day wen the gallant
    Count der WENNIS shall lead his lovely Bride to the halter of
    St. George's, Hannower Squeer, thus proving the truth of the
    Poet's fabel,&mdash;</p>

    <h2>ANNALS OF A WATERING-PLACE</h2>

    <h3>THAT "HAS SEEN ITS DAY."</h3>

    <p>I do not know when Torsington-on-Sea's day precisely was,
    or, whether indeed its day has yet dawned, but I was sent there
    by my medical adviser as being <i>the very place</i> for me, it
    being "delightfully quiet", nine miles from a railway station,
    which apparently means in plain English twenty-four hours
    behind the rest of this habitable globe, and generally stranded
    in the race for every conceivable comfort or necessity with
    which an age of Co-operative Stores and Electric Lighting has
    made one comfortably&mdash;perhaps too
    comfortably&mdash;familiar. Judging, however, from the fact
    that Torsington-on-Sea consists mainly of a pretentious
    architectural effort consisting of six-and-thirty palatial
    sea-side residences, twenty-four of which are let in sets of
    furnished apartments to highly respectable families, and twelve
    of which appear, from want of funds, to have stopped short in
    their infancy many years ago at the basement, showing a
    weed-covered foundation of what might, had the over-sanguine
    capitalist not overshot the initial mark, have proved as fine a
    sea-side terrace on the South East Coast as the weary cockney
    eye could well hope to light upon, it would be including the
    fact that there is but one policeman to protect the lives and
    properties of the inhabitants and strangers of
    Torsington-on-Sea, by day and by night, and a town band (with a
    uniform) of five, of which two-fifths are, I was going to say
    "armed" with cymbals, triangle and with big and side drums, it
    would be more reasonable to suppose that Torsington-on-Sea had
    seen its day, and that what glories it ever had may be regarded
    as having departed with the vanished years.</p>

        <a href="images/131-2.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="Torsington-on-Sea." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Beyond the stock recreation afforded by the
    militarily-apparelled Town Band of five, whose
    <i>répertoire</i> appears to be confined to a sad and serious
    opening march, a rather lugubrious galop, and a couple of
    valses and a quick-step Polka, which evidently owe their origin
    to the genius of the Conductor, the entertainment offered by
    Torsington-on-Sea must be further sought for from a
    donkey-chair, the donkey attached to which has many a long year
    ago lost what it ever possessed in the shape of "spirit," a
    cast-off Nigger Minstrel, with a concertina that is somewhat
    out of order, and a lovely "public-house" tenor, who is heard
    only after dark, but with a voice so sweet and true in tone,
    that one wonders how it is that instead of thrilling the High
    Street of Torsington-on-Sea for possibly the few halfpence he
    picks up in that rather unappreciative thoroughfare, he is not
    simultaneously rushed at and eagerly caught up by the leading
    <i>impressarios</i> of all the continental opera-houses in
    Europe!</p>

    <p>Then there is the daily arrival of the "coach," for such is
    the faded yellow omnibus styled, that meets the London train
    from Boxminster, which pulls up with a flourish at the "Three
    Golden Cups." There is seldom anything brought by this
    noteworthy conveyance, unless it be a package or parcel for Mr.
    DUNSTABLE, the one highly respectable tradesman in the town.
    DUNSTABLE's is <i>the</i> emporium <i>par excellence</i> where
    anything, from a patent drug down to the latest new novel, can
    be ordered down from Town. There is a tradition that old GEORGE
    THE THIRD, when passing through Torsington in the year 1793,
    stopped at DUNSTABLE's for some boot-laces, and, patting the
    grandfather of the present proprietor on the head, said, "What!
    what! none in stock! Then I think we must have some of these
    pretty curls instead." Anyhow, that is given as the reason for
    the style and title of "Dunstable's <i>Royal</i> Library and
    Reading Room," which it has enjoyed without dispute from the
    commencement of the present century to the present day.</p>

    <p>I came here, as I said, by the advice of my medical adviser,
    to "pick up." How far Torsington-on-Sea has helped me to do
    this, I must deal with subsequently.</p>

    <h2>STORICULES.</h2>

    <h3>III.&mdash;THE DEAR OLD LADY.</h3>

    <p>There were three of them in the railway-carriage. One was a
    Stockbroker; one was a Curate; one was an Old Lady. They had
    been strangers to each other when they started; but it was near
    the end of the journey, and they were chatting pleasantly
    together now. One could see that the little Old Lady was from
    the country; she was exquisitely neat and simple in appearance;
    there was an air of primness about her which one rarely sees in
    a city product. She carried a big bunch of hedgerow flowers.
    She seemed to be a little nervous about travelling, and still
    more nervous about encountering the noise and confusion of the
    great city. She had asked the Stockbroker and Curate a good
    many questions about the sights that she ought to see, and how
    much she ought to pay the cabman, and which were the best
    shops. "Not but what TOM will look after me," she explained;
    "Tom's a very good son to me, and he'll be waiting on the
    platform for me. And such a boy as he was too when he was
    younger! Fruit! There wasn't anything that boy wouldn't do to
    get it&mdash;any kind of mischief." She grew garrulous on the
    subject of Tom's infancy. The two men answered her questions,
    and listened amusedly to her chatter. Occasionally they
    interchanged smiles. Presently the train got near to the
    station just before the terminus. The Curate warned the Old
    Lady that the tickets would be collected there.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:35%;">
        <a href="images/132-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/132-1.png"
             alt="The Dear Old Lady." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Thank you, Sir," she said, "for telling me. Then I must be
    getting my ticket ready. I've got it quite safely. Such a lot
    of money it did seem to pay for a ride to London! But TOM
    <i>would</i> have me come. He never forgets his old Mother."
    She undid her reticule and took out her purse; she undid the
    purse and took out a folded paper; she unfolded the paper and
    took out the ticket. Then she put the paper back in the purse,
    and the purse back in the reticule. She held the ticket
    gingerly between two fingers of her cotton-gloved hand, as if
    it were a delicate fruit, and she were afraid of rubbing the
    bloom off it.</p>

    <p>"What a refreshing contrast to our city ways!" thought the
    Stockbroker.</p>

    <p>"<i>How</i> characteristic!" thought the Curate.</p>

    <p>"My word! there's one of my hair-pins coming out," said the
    Old Lady, suddenly. The hand which held the ticket flew to the
    back of her head, to put the hair-pin right.</p>

    <p>And then, all at once, the look of animation died out of the
    Old Lady's face. She seemed utterly aghast and horror-stricken.
    She gasped out an unintelligible interjection.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter, Ma'am?" asked the Stockbroker.</p>

    <p>"My ticket's gone! I was putting that hair-pin right, and
    the ticket slipped out of my fingers, and dropped down the back
    of my neck between my clothes and&mdash;and myself. What
    <i>shall</i> I do when that gentleman comes for the
    tickets?"</p>

    <p>The Curate blushed violently. In his boyhood's days he had
    put halfpennies down the back of his neck and jumped up and
    down until they percolated out in the region of his boots. He
    had only just checked himself in the act of advising the Old
    Lady to get up and jump.</p>

    <p>The Stockbroker was more practical, and soon consoled her.
    He was a season-ticket-holder, and knew the collector. He would
    explain it to the man. "You'll be able to get the ticket again,
    you see, when you&mdash;I mean, later on." The British love of
    euphemism had asserted itself. "And then you can send it to the
    collector by post. You had better write down your name and
    address to give him. I'll guarantee to the collector that it
    will be all right."</p>

    <p>The Old Lady overwhelmed him with thanks. Slowly and
    laboriously she wrote the name and address on the piece of
    paper in which the ticket was folded. All happened just as the
    Stockbroker had foretold. The Ticket-collector was very well
    satisfied and very much amused.</p>

    <p>TOM was waiting for her at the terminus, and took charge of
    her at once.</p>

    <p>"Ah!" said the Stockbroker to the Curate, when she had gone,
    "that's my notion of a dear Old Lady."</p>

    <p>"Everything about her was <i>so</i> characteristic,"
    answered the Curate, admiringly.</p>

    <p>Neither the Curate nor the Stockbroker had the advantage of
    hearing what the dear Old Lady said to Tom that afternoon.</p>

    <p>"It came off just beautifully, my boy. Not that I blame
    <i>them</i>, mind you,&mdash;how were they to know that it was
    a ticket which I didn't give up last year, and that I hadn't
    even taken a ticket at all to-day? No, I don't blame them. As
    for the address, I put the same address that was on the label
    of the Curate's bag, only I altered The Rev. CHARLES
    MARLINGHURST to Mrs. MARLINGHURST. And the Stockbroker
    guaranteed that I should send either the ticket or the money.
    So he'll have to pay up! Oh, my word! My gracious word, what a
    treat!"</p>

    <p>The dear Old Lady chuckled contentedly.</p>

    <p>Tom also chuckled.</p>

    <p>The Stockbroker subsequently relinquished to a great extent
    his habit of remarking upon his own marvellous intuition,
    enabling him to read character at sight; the Curate preached a
    capital sermon on the deceptiveness of man, and when he said
    man he meant woman.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
